# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Fatima, a passionate data science student with a strong background in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). My expertise extends to various areas including Android app development, NLP, and prompt engineering. I'm particularly enthusiastic about leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Skills and Expertise

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java
- **Technologies**: Android SDK, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Natural Language Processing**: GPT, LLama, Mistral, Langchain
- **Prompt Engineering**: Skilled in crafting effective prompts for LLMs to achieve desired outputs
- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: Proficient in Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on:

1. **Prompt-Engineered Text Generation**: Leveraged LLMs such as GPT to generate human-like text responses. Developed custom prompts to guide the model in producing specific types of content, such as creative storytelling or technical writing.

2. **Sentiment Analysis with LLMs**: Explored sentiment analysis techniques using Large Language Models. Developed a sentiment analysis tool that utilizes transformers like BERT to analyze the sentiment of text data with high accuracy.

3. **NLP**:  Utilized NLP libraries and frameworks to implement features such as text recognition, sentiment analysis and text generation.
